~~~TA's~~~
In the folder called "executables" there are pre-built executable programs. You can skip the compilation step by going here if you'd like.

for prolog, you can run the program like this:
```
swipl permutations_prolog.pl
permutations([1, 2, 3, 4], L).
```

-What was easy?
Python was easy. Understanding list recursion (i.e. [HEADD | TAIL] ) in the other languages was a pretty easy concept to grab.
Ada was surprisingly easy. Probably because the code on rosettacode was commented and explained well, and I found a few great resources online to understand the mechanics of the language.

-What was hard?
Prolog was the hardest because I couldn't find any documentation on how to create a list from integer k given as a CLI arg. Trying to find out what to research was really hard. It was hard to tell what I didn't understand because I didn't understand anything about the syntax. Older languages were very hard to find examples of.

-Are there noticeable differences in speed?
N/A

-What do you like/dislike?
Instructions weren't that clear. For example "When run, most of your programs should take n as a command-line argument" doesn't tell us what we should expect the TA's.

I like that I now have a greater appreciation for the high level tools that we use today!!

-Did you find iterators to be helpful?
Iterators were definitely helpful.

Much credit is due to https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Permutations#Prolog for helping me understand the implimentation.
